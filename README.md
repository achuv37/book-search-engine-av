# Book-Search-Engine-Av

This Google Books API search engine application was originally built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/ Express.js server and API. This challenge was to take this fully functioning search engine built with a RESTful API and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

## Description
